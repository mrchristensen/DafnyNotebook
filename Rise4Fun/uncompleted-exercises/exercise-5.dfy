//Exercise 5. Change your test method from Exercise 4 to capture the value of max to a variable, and then do the checks from Exercise 4 using the variable. Dafny will reject this program because you are calling max from real code. Fix this problem using a function method.

function max(a: int, b: int): int
{
   // Use your code from Exercise 4
}
method Testing() {
  // Add assertions to check max here. Be sure to capture it to a local variable
}
